    "## What is PEP 8 and Why Does it Exist?\n",
    "\n",
    "PEP 8 (which stands for Python Enhancement Proposal) is a complete set of code writing guidelines that maximizes readability of Python code, which is important since code tends to be read more than written. \n",
    "\n",
    "PEP 8 covers styling choices like whitespace, code layout, and naming conventions. I'll attempt to summarize them in this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a `pep8` library that will go through your code and check for items that don't obey PEP 8. This is useful to maintain the readability of your code without having to remember all these guidelines by heart.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a second PEP, PEP 20, that coincides with PEP 8 and helps guide decision making and readability in code writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that strictly adhering to the style guide is not always the best way of doing things, and to know when it's appropriate to not follow it. Readability is good, but consistency is best.\n",
    "***\n",

    "\n",
    "### Indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4 spaces should be used per indentation level\n",
    "- Continuing long lines can have parentheses or an extra indentation level\n",
    "    - These lines should be vertically aligned\n",
    "- Hanging indents can also be used - a line ends with a `(` and all succeeding statements must be indented until the closing `)`\n",
    "- `if` statements with long lines can also be indented, and comments can be used to distinuguish the conditions from the succeeding functions\n",
    "- Parentheses and brackets can end under the first character of the indent, or under the first character of the overall statement"
